# What is Wireframing?

Wireframes provide a skeletal outline, focusing on layout and content structure.

## Why Wireframing Matters
Wireframing plays an important role in the design process because it:

- **Provides clarity** – defines where key elements will appear on the screen.  
- **Supports collaboration** – helps designers, developers, and stakeholders align on structure before visual design.  
- **Saves time and cost** – identifies usability issues early, preventing expensive rework later.  
- **Improves user experience** – emphasizes navigation and flow, ensuring the final product is intuitive.
